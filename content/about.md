# About

SysAdmin. Father. Growing to be a better partner. IT Operations looking at InfoSec. Plays a cat covered in churned cream, a culinary catastrophe, condiment coated and carousing on Mastodon. I'll be putting my thoughts here, such as they are.

## ToDo

Some of this is chores, some of this is blog posts

- Better title than "My blog yo"
- ~~Better About than default~~
- ~~Make repo public~~
- Get images in comments working
- Automate comment thread creation and linking
- Why blog?
- How blog?
- Benign True Positive as a valid category, reaction to BHIS livestream 2025-04-24
- https://blog.embee.co/posts/11ty-open-graph-funtimes
- ~~Mastodon profile verification and author attribution~~
